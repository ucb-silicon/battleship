battleship
==========

This program plays battleship. Just run it using node:

node battleship.js

You need to edit the file and added the user id and the board_id.

The battleship.cc file is an experimental program to generate a sample position to hit based on a 2D PDF of hit locations. Not linked to main .js file.
